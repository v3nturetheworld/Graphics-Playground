# OpenGL Playground

### About

This is my repository for experimenting with OpenGL and eventually Vulkan as well as DX12. The goal is to create a simple game with the ambitious idea of having a Graphics Abstraction Layer to support multiple graphics backends, similar to what iD did with the iD tech engine...realistically a simple 3D game engine would be cool.
